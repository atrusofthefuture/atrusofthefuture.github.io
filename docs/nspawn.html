<h1>How to use systemd-nspawn</h1>

<p>
Love it or hate it, systemd would appear to be here to stay. I started my journey with Linux shortly before Ubuntu made the switch, and wasn't experienced enough to make note of the differences, and the controversy went well over my head.

With time as I got to know the init system I began to understand the drawbacks and limitations of either approach -- a monolithic init system like systemd or a Unix-style one where tasks are more distributed.

While personally I haven't made a final determination, I have been able to squeeze some functionality out of systemd and nspawn is one of the systems I've come to like.

It has similarities to LXC and Linux Containers; less resource overhead than a fully virtualized system. An nspawn container shares kernel space with the host system
